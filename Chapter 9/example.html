        - To associate an AngularJS application with a region of an HTML document
        - To act as a gateway to key AngularJS framework features
        - To help organize the code and components in an AngularJS application */

        - name (in this case myApp) is the name of the new module (the naming convention is to use the suffix App)
        - requires is the set of modules that the module depends on
        - config which is the configuration for the module, equivalent to calling the Module.config method */

        /* When creating a module you must specify the name and requires arguments, even if your module has no dependencies.  
        an example of that would be - var myApp = angular.module("exampleApp");
        The effect of doing this way is that angular tries to find a previously created module called exampleApp, instead of creating a new one. */

            they are responsible for creating the object that angularJS will employ to perform the work itself. 
            Often, factory functions will return a worker function.  In the example below the return statement in the factory function returns another function, which will invoke each time
            it needs to apply the directive, and this is the worker function. */
